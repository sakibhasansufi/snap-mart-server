But with the new Zen 4 microarchitecture, rates may reach 5.7 GHz, an astounding 800 MHz boost over the previous generation, and up to 13% more IPC. As a consequence, single-threaded performance is up 29% compared to the previous-generation CPUs. As for threaded workloads, AMD claims up to 45% greater performance in applications with higher performance requirements.",

The 3.5-inch LCD panel on ROG Ryujin II is the largest LCD display on an AIO cooler in the industry and infuses your build with customizable visuals. The LCD panel can be tuned via Armoury Crate to display crucial system information, such as temperatures, voltages, fan speeds, or frequencies. Images and animation can be uploaded to show them off on the LCD panel, giving your build your own personal touch. ROG Ryujin II series includes a one-year subscription for the AIDA64 Extreme software, which provides advanced monitoring of hardware and software and offers exclusive in-screens that displays system and component performance. To overcome the thermal challenges of the latest multi-core CPUs, ROG Ryujin II offers industrial-grade Noctua iPPC-2000 PWM radiator fans that deliver high performance and minimal-noise operation. ROG Ryujin II conquers a limitation of traditional liquid coolers by providing a 60 mm fan embedded in the pump housing to ensure ample airflow to the CPU socket area. This fan circulates air to the CPU VRMs, M.2 slot, and surrounding components to reduce temperatures for added performance and stability. The controller for ROG Ryujin II features four PWM fan headers that can be tuned via FanXpert 4. It also offers four ARGB headers to link with addressable strips and components for lighting up your build. ROG Ryujin II series is compatible with a wide range of Intel and AMD motherboard platforms, giving you the flexibility to pair it with your choice of processor.
